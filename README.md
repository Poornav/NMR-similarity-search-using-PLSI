# NMR-similarity-search-using-PLSI
Replicating the results of the paper "Similarity Search for Multi-dimensional NMR-Spectra of Natural Products" by  Wolfram et al. 2006 . We are using our own dataset (extracted from HMDB website). The results that we get  are used as a baseline for SMART (https://github.com/nick11roberts/hsqc_spectra)
